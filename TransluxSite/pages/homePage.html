        <p ng-show="para == 1">After six years of operation and close to 80 million passenger trips, the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) has demonstrated that the face of public transport can be radically changed. A modern and efficient public transport system such as Translux has had a positive impact on the provincial economy, alleviated traffic congestion and rejuvenated several inner cities in Johannesburg and Tshwane. It has created jobs and helped to re-establish the rail sector in our province.</p>
        <p ng-show="para == 2">These Conditions of Carriage set out the terms that govern the relationship, responsibilities and liabilities as between the Passenger and the Carrier and are BINDING ON THE PARTIES.
        The Passenger has entered into a Passage Contract with an Organiser and these conditions have been incorporated into the Passengerâ€™s contract with the Organiser. These Terms and Conditions of Carriage will also apply where the Vessel is being used as a floating hotel whether or not there is a Passage Contract and whether or not there is any carriage. </p>
